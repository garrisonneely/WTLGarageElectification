# Watertower Lofts — Garage Electrification Subcommittee

Date started: 2026-01-24

## Purpose
Build a practical, phased plan to eventually provide **Level 2 (L2) charging** to **as many resident vehicles as want it**, while keeping costs, safety, fairness, and electrical constraints explicit.

## Why this exists
Today we have:
- A single L2 hookup that appears to fully subscribe the current garage distribution capacity.
- Two additional spots using long extension cords (unsafe / noncompliant / operationally messy).
- Uncertainty about upstream utility capacity (Xcel) and whether a recent nearby infrastructure improvement changed that constraint.

This repository is a shared workspace for the subcommittee: proposals, meeting notes, vendor/electrician info, and decision records.

## Repo structure
- docs/ — Proposals, requirements, decision memos
- meeting-notes/ — Meeting agendas + notes (dated)
- artifacts/ — PDFs, photos, sketches, utility responses (avoid PII)
